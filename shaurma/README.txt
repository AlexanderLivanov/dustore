Modern admin UI (TailAdmin-inspired) — Unusual navigation (bottom dock + contextual panels)
Included files:
- index.php (dashboard)
- studio.php, employees.php, projects.php, reviews.php, analytics.php, admin.php
- assets/css/styles.css
- assets/js/app.js
Notes:
- This package changes only frontend templates/styles. Do NOT change your PHP backend logic.
- Header/footer includes are left as simple PHP include placeholders (you can adapt to your project).
- Uses Tailwind CDN for quick styling. If you want pure local CSS, tell me and I'll convert it.
